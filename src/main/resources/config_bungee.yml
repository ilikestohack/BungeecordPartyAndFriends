  # WARNING: Due to changes in minecraft it is not possible to let players execute commands beginning with minecraft
  # version 1.19. Therefor this function is not available for minecraft versions  1.19 and up.
  # If you want to use this feature on a server with minecraft 1.19 or later players please use the
  # Extended version (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/paf-extended.10123/). It fixes the problem by having the plugin
  # installed on the bungeecord and spigot server.
  #
  #
  # If this is activated all commands listed under Commands will be executed by everyone in the party when the leader
  # executes the command, if they are on the same server as the party leader. This option only exists for mini-games
  # which don't have a bungee/proxy mode. You should always prefer the bungee mode, as it uses less performance and
  # everybody in the party joins the mini-game, even if they are not on the same server. Please notice that most command
  # GUIs don't handle the simulating of command correctly, which causes them to not be recognised as commands
